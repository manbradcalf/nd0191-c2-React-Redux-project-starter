# Employee Polls

Employee Polls is a React application which enables employees to ask and answer
various questions or "polls". The questions and answers are tracked and the
leader is determined by which user has asked and answered the most questions.

## Dependencies

Employee Polls uses react-redux to manage a single store object which is then used
by connected components who connect to it's state updates using
`connect(mapStateToProps)(nameOfComponent)`. Components read the state from
the store updates via the `mapStateToProps` function and update the state by dispatching events for redux
to handle via the `dispatch` method. `dispatch` lives on the `store` and is provided by wrapping the `App`
component inside of a `Provider` wrapper which contains the redux `store` component

This application also uses `BrowserRouter` to handle navigation between
components.

The login functionality is simple for now, allowing only
impersonation of existing users, but future improvements will include a full
authentication flow.

## Tests

Inside the `employee-polls/src/tests/` directory are unit tests which can be
run by executing `npm test`.
These tests check that the components match the expected snapshot as well as validates some of the fetching logic which lives in
the `api.js` file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
